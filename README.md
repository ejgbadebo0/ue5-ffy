# Unreal Engine - FFY Project

This is a personal project written in Unreal Engine's C++ scripting
framework that implements systems found in games like the Final Fantasy 
and Kingdom Hearts series. The class implementations found in the source
code are templates intended to be extended in the Unreal Engine editor by
Blueprint child classes.
